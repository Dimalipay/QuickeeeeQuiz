Hi, Iâ€™m @Dimalipay
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Java and Adroid studio
this is my first project

As an idea for my first project, I chose the theme of creating a mobile quiz application.
After launching the application, a screen with a start button appears in front of you.

Then you will go to the level selection menu. The levels are arranged as they become more difficult.

After choosing a level, a dialog box will open in front of you, where tasks for passing the level will be written. You can start the passage by clicking on the continue button or return to the level selection menu by clicking on the cross in the upper left corner of the dialog box. Before you appear 2 cards with possible options from which you must select the appropriate condition. For choosing the correct answer, you are given 1 point, which is displayed in green at the top construction site showing the progress of passing this level. For choosing the wrong answer, you will be charged 2 points. Also, most levels have a countdown timer to limit the user in time to complete the level. If the timer runs out, you will be returned to the level selection menu and your progress on the level will be reset.

After passing the level, falling candies will appear in the background, as well as an interesting fact about the topic of this level.

Also in the game there is vibration when you click on the correct and incorrect answer, differing in their intensity. There is also background music to relax the user (no copyright music). I would also like to note that if the user for some reason has not passed all the levels, his progress will be saved.
After that, the user has gone through all 20 levels in front of him, a screen will appear with congratulations on the passage of the game.
